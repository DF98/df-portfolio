            I am a web developer who loves learning new languages and tools, to
            create modern websites that are fast and provide an excellent user
            experience.

            My formal education at <span class="font-bold italic text-primary"
                >Monash University</span
            > where I completed my <span class="font-bold italic text-primary"
                >Bachelor of Information Technology</span
            > is where I learnt the fundamentals in programming, in multiple
            languages. During my time I completed many units that involved web
            development, one unit in particular that spanned an entire year was
            called Industry Experience. In this unit I developed a web
            application in a team, for a client wanting to create an
            informational website for carers of people with nerological
            disorders.

            The years after completing my degree, I spent most of my free time
            learning new languages and web frameworks as I was, and still am
            interested in a career in web development. My most recent endevours
            include obtaining my <span class="font-bold italic text-primary"
                >AWS Solutions Architect Associate Certification</span
            >, and learning WordPress to start creating websites for small
            bussinesses.
